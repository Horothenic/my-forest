The player is taking care of an island so small steps every day make the island better.

1. Log in daily for a Growth.
	1. Here you can notice maybe a new animal visited, it will be recorded in the [[Wildlife Almanac]]
2. Spend the growth.
	1. Player can spend it on planting trees or getting upgrades, new trees will be recorded in the [[Botanical Compendium]]
3. Wait for the next day.

Take note cause the ´Day´ is not a real day, it can be set of hours, days or minutes.

- For the tutorial the days will last seconds or minutes.
- The default would be 1 hour.
	- It can be improved to give more points in a single day with progress.

To achieve this loop we develop the following:
- Plant trees.
- Get growth every day.
- Spend growth.
- Spawn animal.
- Record tree or animal found.
