Every know and then an animal will visit the forest and the [[Wildlife Almanac]] will register it.

The rate of this can vary based on the following:
- Forest size.
- Flora discovered.

And the animal that can visit depends on the following:
- Amount of flora of an specific type in the forest.
- Visits of other animals.

The game will trigger a local notification based on the rate, when that triggers a animal visited on a random spot on the forest based on the requirements of the animal.

If the animal likes an specific kind of tree it will appear close to one.

The visit will end after 15 min automatically or if the game is closed.

Only one visit can happen at a time, unless you buy more visit slots with a [[Natural Augments]].
