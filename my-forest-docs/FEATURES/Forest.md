This is the most important feature and the hardest one to make, mainly because I have been trying to make a few versions of it without a good candidate.

You can review them in [[Failed Forests]] to check what has been tried and did not work.

**VISUAL STYLE**
We first need to find a [[Visual Style]], but seems that low poly is the absolute winner, that's nice cause we already have a lot of assets and they all are low poly.

**TERRAIN**
The next thing we need is how to create the [[Terrain]].

**HUD**
You can see how many days you have taken care of the forest.

**FLORA**
Every day the trees grow a little and the user gain [[Growth]] points.
