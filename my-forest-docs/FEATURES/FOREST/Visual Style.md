 Low poly art looks promising, the reason we don't want to go with voxels anymore is because of the grid, we learned a grid can be more problems than help in this case.

We can have an algorithm to place stuff on the new "empty" discovered space based on random rules maybe, to know if we need to place stones, stumps or other things.

Mountains don't look bad but I think the game will not handle them good, let's thing of them as a nice to have, what I think we should do tho is find a way to create random good base terrain with low poly style and the ability to increase it by chunks.

Adding many flowers looks like a good idea.

We can have premade chunks if the random algorithm does not work, and just have a lot of variants of it, changing rotation or size, but I would prefer the random algo better.

This image made me think on increasing the forest like an island in the sky, if it grows from a side it should adapt the mesh on the top and the bottom to fill the gaps and still look like an island, that can be a challenge by itself tho

The style also will help for animals since low poly animals are cute and easier to do.
